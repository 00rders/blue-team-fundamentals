# üß† Unified Kill Chain ‚Äì Field Reference

A tactical reference sheet for the Unified Kill Chain ‚Äî a comprehensive model combining Cyber Kill Chain and MITRE ATT&CK to map adversary operations in full detail.

---

## üìö Unified Kill Chain Phases

The Unified Kill Chain has **18 attack phases**, grouped into 3 categories:

### üîç Initial Foothold

1. **Reconnaissance** ‚Äì Identify potential targets and vulnerabilities  
2. **Weaponization** ‚Äì Create or prepare attack payloads  
3. **Delivery** ‚Äì Transmit payload (e.g., phishing, USB, drive-by)  
4. **Social Engineering** ‚Äì Trick the user into executing payload  
5. **Exploitation** ‚Äì Trigger a vulnerability or abuse functionality  
6. **Persistence** ‚Äì Maintain access over time  

### üíª Network Propagation

7. **Command & Control (C2)** ‚Äì Establish communication with remote server  
8. **Internal Reconnaissance** ‚Äì Learn about internal systems, accounts  
9. **Credential Access** ‚Äì Harvest usernames, passwords, tokens  
10. **Privilege Escalation** ‚Äì Gain higher-level permissions  
11. **Lateral Movement** ‚Äì Move between systems in the network  
12. **Collection** ‚Äì Gather sensitive files, logs, or screenshots  

### üéØ Action on Objectives

13. **Exfiltration** ‚Äì Remove data from the target environment  
14. **Impact** ‚Äì Destroy, encrypt, or manipulate systems/data  
15. **Defense Evasion** ‚Äì Disable AV, hide processes, clean logs  
16. **Obfuscation** ‚Äì Encode payloads, use LOLBins, blend in  
17. **Anti-Analysis** ‚Äì Evade sandboxes, delay execution  
18. **Command Repeat** ‚Äì Re-establish C2 or reinitiate attack chain

## üí° Analyst Tips

- The Unified Kill Chain is **non-linear** ‚Äî attackers may skip or repeat steps.
- Most mature threats include **defense evasion + persistence** tactics early.
- Use **MITRE ATT&CK** to map TTPs at each phase with precision.
- Knowing each phase helps **break the chain** early (especially delivery or C2).
- Use it for **threat hunting, detection engineering, and purple teaming**.

| Exfiltration           | DLP tools, compressed archives over DNS/HTTP               |
| Impact                 | File deletion, ransomware behavior, WMI process events     |
| Defense Evasion        | Process hollowing, signed binaries, AV tampering           |
| Obfuscation            | Base64 usage, PowerShell encoding, LOLBins                 |
| Anti-Analysis          | Sandbox evasion, sleep timers, debugger checks             |
| Command Repeat         | Beaconing patterns, retry logic, domain rotation           |

## üß™ Practice Scenario Example

**APT-style Attack Chain:**

- **Recon:** Attacker scans GitHub repos for internal domain leaks  
- **Delivery:** Phishing email with malicious Excel macro  
- **Social Engineering:** Victim opens and enables macros  
- **Exploitation:** Macro spawns obfuscated PowerShell  
- **Persistence:** Registry Run key + scheduled task  
- **C2:** HTTPS beacon to dynamic DNS domain  
- **Recon (internal):** PowerView used to enumerate AD  
- **Cred Access:** Mimikatz run from memory  
- **Priv Esc:** Token impersonation to SYSTEM  
- **Lateral Move:** PsExec used to reach Domain Controller  
- **Collection:** Gathers sensitive HR files  
- **Exfiltration:** Sends ZIP file to Dropbox via API  
- **Impact:** Deletes backups, drops ransomware  
- **Defense Evasion:** Clears logs with wevtutil, sleeps 30 min  
- **Obfuscation:** All scripts base64-encoded  
- **Anti-Analysis:** Macro checks for sandbox and VM  
- **Command Repeat:** Tries fallback C2 via backup domain

## üß≠ Use Cases

- Track **end-to-end attacker movement** across environments  
- Identify **weak detection areas** in the kill chain  
- Create **realistic purple team exercises**  
- Correlate alerts to understand attack progress  
- Strengthen defenses at the **earliest breakable phase**
